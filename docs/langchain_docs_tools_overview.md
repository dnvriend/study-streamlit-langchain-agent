# Langchain Docs: Tools Overview
Source: https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/

Tools are utilities designed to be called by a model: their inputs are designed to be generated by models, and their outputs are designed to be passed back to models.

A toolkit is a collection of tools meant to be used together.
